        Strawberry is a little experiment made by me, who you can just call Nooble. The purpose of this website is for me to gain more experience in web development. There's a bunch of random stuff planned for this site, including games that you can play as much as you like. I have no intent on adding any kind of advertisements to this website, because the learning experience and the satisfaction of entertaining people is all the profit I need. At some point, I may add a donation link for those who may want to donate.
